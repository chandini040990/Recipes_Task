Developd a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing recipes using Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose. The application follows the MVC pattern and includes comprehensive API documentation using Postman.

Functionalities:
The following functionality are achieved,

createRecipe: Create a new recipe.
getAllRecipes: Retrieve all recipes.
getRecipeById: Retrieve a single recipe by ID.
updateRecipe: Update a recipe by ID.
deleteRecipe: Delete a recipe by ID.

Techstacks needs to be used : 
Node.js
Express.js
Mongoose (MongoDB)
Postman

How it works:
Follows the MVC pattern with separate folders for models, views, and controllers.
Complete implementation of the CRUD operations.
Fully functional integration with MongoDB using Mongoose.
Detailed documentation for each API endpoint in Postman.
Includes sample requests and responses for each operation and proper error handling and validation.

Error in conecting the MongoDB MongooseServerSelectionError: Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. One common reason is that you're trying to access the database from an IP that isn't whitelisted.
